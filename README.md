# An Election Audit of a U.S. Congressional Precinct in the State of Colorado

## Project Overview of the Election Audit
#### The purpose of this audit was to determine the benefit of using Python code to automate the reporting process of an election.  The code was written and developed within Microsoft Visual Studio Code.  
In order to assist the ***Colorado Board of Elections*** determine the outcome of a congressional election, a code script was written in which the recorded tabulated results were processed with the following outputs:
  1.  The total number of votes cast
  2.  The total number of votes for each candidate
  3.  The percentage of votes for each candidate
  4.  The winner of the election based on popular vote

In addition to the above listed requested detail, the following outputs were also calculated:
  1.  The county with the greatest voter turnout
  2.  The total number of votes cast within each county
  3.  The percentage of the total number of votes cast within each county
#### Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.54.3

Is there a way to automate the process using Python?
If the audit is done successfully with Python
    Code may be used for other congressional districts, Senatorial districts, and local elections
